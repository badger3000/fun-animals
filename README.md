Fun Animals Demo Site
</h1>

Welcome to the Fun Animals Repo. This is a demo project based in [GastbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [ReactJS](https://react.dev/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/),[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)

View the [Live preview](https://main--subtle-capybara-9b1e80.netlify.app/)

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Grab the code.**

    Clone the Github Repository [HERE](https://github.com/badger3000/fun-animals.git)

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/badger3000/fun-animals.git
    ```

1.  **Navigate to directory and Install dependency.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd fun-animals/
    npm install

    ```

1.  **Run Development.**

    ```shell
    npm run start
    ```

    NOTE: you will need a [Contentful API Key](https://app.contentful.com/spaces/vb3octyohlfd/api/keys) and matching data schema to load items on the frontend. Use the .envEXAMPLE file to get starting adding these keys to your project

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries).
